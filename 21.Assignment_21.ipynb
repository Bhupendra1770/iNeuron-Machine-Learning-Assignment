These Decision        Trees would likely perform worse than the first Decision Tree, achieving only around 80% accuracy, since they were trained on smaller sets.\n",
    "3. Now the magic begins. Create 1,000 Decision Tree predictions for each test set case, and keep only the most common prediction (you can do this with SciPy's mode() function). Over the test collection, this method gives you majority-vote predictions.\n",
    "4. On the test range, evaluate these predictions: you should achieve a slightly higher accuracy than the first model (approx 0.5 to 1.5 percent higher). You've successfully learned a Random Forest classifier!"
