    "### 1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\" ?\n",
    "Ans: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.In ML we try to get important information from data and we use that information for prediction."

    "Ans: The training set is used to train the algorithm, and then you use the trained model on the test set to predict the response variable values that are already known. The final step is to compare the predicted responses against the actual (observed) responses to see how close they are."

    "Ans: It is a way to train your model on data that cannot fit your core memory. Out-of-core learning refers to the machine learning algorithms working with data that cannot fit into a single machine's memory but can easily fit into some data storage, like web repository. It uses online learning system to feed data in small bits."

We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function."
