Moreover, these methods depend on the efficient selection of classifiers for obtaining high accuracy"

    "\n",
    "Cluster analysis plays vital role in pattern recognition in several fields of science. Silhouette width is a widely used index for assessing the fit of individual objects in the classification, as well as the quality of clusters and the entire classification. Silhouette combines two clustering criteria, compactness and separation, which imply that spherical cluster shapes are preferred over others—a property that can be seen as a disadvantage in the presence of complex, nonspherical clusters, which is common in real situations. We suggest a generalization of the silhouette width using the generalized mean. By changing the p parameter of the generalized mean between −∞ and +∞, several specific summary statistics, including the minimum, maximum, the arithmetic, harmonic, and geometric means, can be reproduced. Implementing the generalized mean in the calculation of silhouette width allows for changing the sensitivity of the index to compactness versus connectedness. With higher sensitivity to connectedness, the preference of silhouette width toward spherical clusters should reduce.\n",

    "\n",
    "An ROC curve plots TPR vs. FPR at different classification thresholds. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positives and True Positives.To compute the points in an ROC curve, we could evaluate a logistic regression model many times with different classification thresholds, but this would be inefficient. Fortunately, there's an efficient, sorting-based algorithm that can provide this information for us, called AUC.\n",
