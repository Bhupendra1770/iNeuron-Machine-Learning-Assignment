    "Ans: \n",
    "- Under the supervision of experts- Human-guided machine learning is a process whereby subject matter experts accelerate the learning process by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation Concept Learning.\n",

    "- With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner- Well The process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance Operant Conditioning.\n",
